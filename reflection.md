# Assignment 1 Reflection

## Reflection and Code Review Process

1. Code functionality.

"< !-- -->" : Comment symbol. This comment symbol works in both single line and multi line comments
short cut (ctrl + /) for comments

"DOCTYPE html" : This is to initialize the type of Document to be used, html is used in this instance.

html lang="eng": This is the official language used. "eng" for English

< img src="Wendy.jpg" alt="Resume image" height="150" width="150"> : This line is used to import an image and can be adjusted.
Note: Image must be in the same folder as .html.

head
< meta charset="UTF-8" / >
< meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" / >
< title >Resume< /title >
head
The above syntax represents the character set and the title "Resume"

< body ></ body > : This will contain semantic html elements

< a href=" https://mb360.ca/">Centralized Database for OAT</ a > : this line is used as an attribute for a specific destination.

< ul> < /ul> : Unordered list that contains information that are not in any order

< li> </ li> : is used inside ul as list of information

## Semantic Elements
1. < h1> </ h1> : largest text available
2. < h2> </ h2> : Text are available up to h6, but the bigger the number, the smaller the text.
3. < img> : used to import image
4.  < ul> < /ul> : Unordered list
5. < ol> < /ol> : Ordered list


## Code Challenges

The lack of html experience has made a basic assignment very time consuming due to the constant review of notes.
Making sure that my headers are uniformed and my lists are well structured took more time than expected.

## Approach

What would I do Different?
 - I would create a diagram mapping exactly what style and structure I would do. Create a cheat sheet of all Elements to save time, instead of going back and forth to my notes. 
 
 ## Conclusion

Overall, it was a fun assignment having no limitation on what I can come up with as a newbie developer. This will only improve as I gain experience and knowledge.
