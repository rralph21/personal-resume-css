## Code challenges

Similar to assignment 1, the main challenge that I had on this assignment is time management since 
I need more time to look over the notes and use resources like w3schools.

## Approach

What would I do Different?
I would honestly create a diagram to clearly layout the design of the enhancement that I wanted to do with my resume.
Also to have a clear plan.

## Conclusion

Assignment 2 did not feel like an assignment but an exercise on creativity. Looking forward on enhancing my knowledge on HTML, CSS
and future projects.
